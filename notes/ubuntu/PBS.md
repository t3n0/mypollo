# Installing PBS on Ubuntu

PBS stands for [Postable Batch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System) and refers to the software that schedules and organise tasks to be run on a computer or cluster of computers.
Among many others job scheduling and workload management softwares, PBS comes in an open source flavor under the name of [OpenPBS](https://www.openpbs.org/).
Other information about the OpenPBS project and community can be found in the main README page of the [project](https://github.com/openpbs/openpbs).
