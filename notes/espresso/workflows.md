# Quantum Espresso workflows

A table with some of the possible workflows of Quantum Espresso.  
Each column represents a property that we want to calculate.
For any given column, the entries are the executable tools (e.g. `pw.x`, `ph.x`, `dos.x`, etc.) needed to be run to execute that specific workflow.
Each entry shows a brief description of the executable and links to an example.
The top entry of any workflow is a link to a zip file that can be download and run.
