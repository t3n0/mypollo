# Installing Siesta v5.0.0+

Super straight forward guide to install [Siesta](https://siesta-project.org/siesta/) version >=5.0.0 on Ubuntu (because windows... why?).\
The full installation manual can be found [here](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/latest/how-to/index.html#how-to-build-siesta).

## Prerequisites

1. Install `gfortran`
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential gfortran
   ```
3. Install an MPI implementation: for example `openmpi`
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin
   ```
3. Install `blas`, `lapack` and `scalapack` libraries
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapack-dev libscalapack-mpi-dev
   ```
4. Install `HDF5` and `NetCDF` input/output libraries
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libhdf5-dev libhdf5-mpi-dev libnetcdf-dev libnetcdff-dev netcdf-bin
   ```
5. Install `curl` and/or `wget`
   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl wget
   ```
6. Siesta needs `CMake` >= 3.17. To install CMake just type
   ```bash
   sudo apt install cmake
   ```
   Check you CMake version by typing `CMake --version`. If this version is not up to date, you have two options:

   <summary>Install via snap</summary>
      
      1. Uninstall the current CMake
         
         ```bash
         sudo apt purge --auto-remove cmake
         ```
      2. Simply run
         ```bash
         sudo snap install cmake --classic
         ```
         the `--classic` flag is necessary because cmake uses a classic [snap confinement](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement).

   <summary>Install manually</summary>

      1. Uninstall the current CMake
         
         ```bash
         sudo apt purge --auto-remove cmake
         ```
      2. Download the latest binary release from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download).
         For example, at the time of writing, this is `cmake-3.27.7-linux-x86_64.sh`.
      3. Copy the script file in some meaningfull folder
         ```bash
         cp cmake-3.27.7-linux-x86_64.sh /home/user/cmake/
         ```
         Of course, replace the name with your cmake version.
      4. Execute the script
         ```bash
         bash cmake-3.27.7-linux-x86_64.sh
         ```
         and follow the instructions: accept license yes, version folder yes.
      5. Export the `/home/user/cmake/bin` to PATH or link the binaries to the `/usr/local/bin`.

##  Create environment and download the sources

8. [Download](https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta/-/releases) the latest release in the `.tar.gz` format and extract the content to `/home/user/siesta/`.
9. Move to `/home/user/siesta/siesta-5.0.0` (depending on your version) and run
   ```bash
   cmake
   ```

After one week of blasphemies, I didn't manage to install siesta.\
Some flook problems, lua.c something, <readline/readline.h> not found ???\
Siesta go to hell! I'll just stick with quantum-espresso.
