# Download hyperlink

If we have a file that **the browser cannot read directly**, we can create a raw link that starts the **download**.\
For example, the link to a `.zip` file in this repository is

https://github.com/t3n0/notes/blob/main/notes/other/raw.zip

By clicking the above link, we will just move to that specific `.zip` file but the browser cannot render it.

To generate the download link we need to do the following:
1. navigate to the desired github file;
2. right click on the `raw` button on the top right \
   ![raw1](raw1.png)
3. select `copy link` \
   ![raw2](raw2.png)
4. paste the link anywhere you like, for example [here](https://github.com/t3n0/notes/raw/main/other/raw.zip).

Clicking the above starts the download immediately.
