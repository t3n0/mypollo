# Notebooks

This a collection of jupyter notebooks made by [me](https://github.com/t3n0). It includes little projects, routines and physics lectures and excercises.

Most notebooks can be [binderized](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/t3n0/notebooks/HEAD) and are ready to be used (loading binder takes a little time, don't despare).
Others probabily lack of the necessary dependencies/widgets to properly be rendered on binder. Just download whatever you need and try to run it locally.

# Contents

1. [Routines](https://github.com/t3n0/notebooks/tree/main/routines):
    - [Fourier interpolation](https://github.com/t3n0/notebooks/blob/main/routines/Fourier%20Interpolation.ipynb)
    - [2D line approximated by pixels](https://github.com/t3n0/notebooks/blob/main/routines/pixel%20line%20in%202D.ipynb)
    - [winding number of a polygon](https://github.com/t3n0/notebooks/blob/main/routines/winding%20number%20of%20a%20polygon.ipynb), checks wheter a point is contained into a given polygon
2. Physics lectures:
    - Maxwell equations
    - cicciopasticcio
