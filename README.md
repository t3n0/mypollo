# Tentacolo: my notes, scripts and memos

This repo is a collection of notes, links, scripts, lectures and ideas spanning a number of different topics.\
The purpose is to collect in a single place all these useful information without googling them from scratch.\
All the contents are proudly made by [me][me].
