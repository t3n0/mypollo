    - [Fourier interpolation][fourier]
    - [2D line approximated by pixels][line2D]
    - [winding number of a polygon][winding], checks wheter a point is contained into a given polygon
2. [Lectures and excercises][lectures]:
    - [1D Maxwell equations][maxwell1D] at planar interface and normal incidence
    - [Ising model][ising]
    - [finite quantum square well][qw1d] in 1D
    - [timing and profiling python][pyprofile]
3. [Python common practise, syntax and useful templates][python]:
   - pollo
