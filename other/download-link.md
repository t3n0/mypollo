# Download hyperlink

If we have a file that the browser cannot read directly, we can create a raw link that starts the download.
For example, the link to a `.zip` file in this repository is

https://github.com/t3n0/notes/blob/main/other/download-link.md

By clicking the above link, we will just move to this specific github page.

To generate a link that starts the **download** immediately we need to do the following:
1. navigate to the desired github file;
2. right click on the `raw` button on the top right \
   ![raw1](raw1.png)
4. select `copy link` \
   ![raw2](raw2.png)
6. paste the link anywhere you like, for example [here](https://github.com/t3n0/notes/raw/main/other/download-link.md).
