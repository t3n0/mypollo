# A clickable link that directly starts the download

We have a file in a repository that we want to share. For example, this very same [markdown file](https://github.com/t3n0/notes/edit/main/other/download-link.md).\

https://github.com/t3n0/notes/edit/main/other/download-link.md

By clicking the above link, we will just move to that specific github page.
