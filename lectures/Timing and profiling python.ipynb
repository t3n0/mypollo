    "# Timing and profiling python\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing efficient code is a difficult matter. High-level programming languages (like python) provide multiple ways of performing the same tasks. Certain programming choices can be faster, more reliable and more efficient than others. And assessing the efficiency of different implementations is an important skill to learn.\n",
    "Beware however not to indulge to much into code optimisation at the early stage of development. A famous quote from Donald Knuth states, \"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, let's dig into the most useful python libraries for profiling and timing our code.\n",
    "Within the Jupyter (or IPython) environment, we will explore the capabilities of the following **magic commands**:\n",
    "* `%time`: elapsed time of a statement *single call*\n",
    "* `%timeit`: average elapsed time of a statement *multiple calls* (for better accuracy)\n",
    "* `%prun`: elapsed time *line-by-line* of a statement\n",
    "* `%lprun`: similar to the above, but more precise\n",
    "* `%memit`: memory usage of a single statement\n",
    "* `%mprun`: memory usage of a single statement, line-by-line\n",
    "\n",
    "The last three commands are not part of the default python distribution and must be manually installed.\n",
    "The packages required are `line_profiler` and `memory_profiler`. These can be easily installed with `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ pip install line_profiler`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or with `anaconda`\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ conda install -c anaconda memory_profiler`\n",
    "\n",
    "(sorry, don't know how to do that in Windows).\n",
